# 30-day-streak

For the final project of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp we were required to develop  a MERN full stack application with user authentication multiple data models and full CRUD functionality.

Together with [Anna Waszak](https://github.com/annawaszak) and [Katie Gracey](https://github.com/kgracey93) I developed a habit tracking app over nine days. The app allows users to select or create thirty-day habit-training challenges and track them in the app. They can also define  prizes that the app awards them for successful progress and a main prize for completing the challenge successfully.

The project was voted best of the cohort both by the cohort members and a public hackshow at the end of ther course!
